<h2>The (Compressed, Generalizable) Zen of Python</h2>
Beautiful is better than ugly. <br> <br>
Simple is better than complex. <br> <br>
Complex is better than complicated. <br> <br>
Sparse is better than dense. <br> <br>
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. <br> <br>
Although practicality beats purity. <br> <br>
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. <br> <br>
There should be one — and preferably only one — obvious way to do it. <br> <br>
Now is better than never. <br> <br>
Although never is often better than right now. <br> <br>
If implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. <br> <br>
If implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. <br> <br>
